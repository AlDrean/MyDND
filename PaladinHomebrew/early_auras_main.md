# Early Game Auras - Main Document

> **Goal:** Design level 1 auras that are thematically tied to gods, divine domains, or spiritual concepts rather than generic mechanical effects. These auras should reflect the Paladin's connection to the divine and their specific faith.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Thematic First:** Auras should feel like blessings from specific gods or divine concepts
- **Level 1 Access:** Available from 1st level to establish Paladin identity early
- **Charisma Scaling:** Effects scale with Charisma modifier to grow with the character
- **Passive with Active Elements:** Primarily passive benefits, but can have active components
- **Oath Connection:** May relate to or complement the Paladin's chosen Oath
- **World Interaction:** Auras should interact with the world in creative, narrative ways beyond simple bonuses
- **Test Improvements Focus:** Auras primarily improve ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls (no AC changes)
- **Low Power Early Game:** Effects are subtle but meaningful, appropriate for 1st level characters
- **Creative & Flavorful:** Effects should feel magical and divine, changing how the world works around the Paladin

### Scaling System (From Guidelines)
- **+1 Charisma:** Coin flip (1d2)
- **+2 Charisma:** d4
- **+3 Charisma:** d4 + 1d2
- **+4 Charisma:** Advantage roll (2d6)
- **+5 Charisma:** Maximum of 2d4 or sum of 2d4

## Implementation Ideas

### Option A: Choose at Level 1
- Paladin chooses one god/theme-based aura at 1st level
- This becomes their signature aura, tied to their faith
- Scales with Charisma modifier
- May unlock additional auras at higher levels

### Option B: Oath-Linked
- Each Oath grants access to specific god/theme auras
- Paladin chooses from their Oath's available auras at 1st level
- Creates stronger thematic connection between Oath and aura

### Option C: Deity Worship
- Paladin's chosen deity determines available auras
- Multiple deities might share similar auras (e.g., multiple gods of war)
- Allows for more personalized divine connection

### Option D: Universal with Variants
- All Paladins get a base "Aura of Faith" at level 1
- Different gods/themes provide different mechanical expressions
- Same core concept, different flavor and effects

## Questions to Consider

1. **Should auras be:**
   - Always active (passive)?
   - Toggleable (can be turned on/off)?
   - Resource-based (uses per day)?

2. **How should they interact with:**
   - Existing level 6 Aura of Protection?
   - Oath-specific features?
   - Other Paladin abilities?

3. **Should there be:**
   - One aura per Paladin?
   - Multiple auras that can be switched?
   - Aura progression/evolution?

4. **Balance concerns:**
   - Are these too powerful for level 1?
   - Should they have limitations (concentration, uses per day)?
   - How do they compare to other level 1 features?

- [ ] Refine specific aura effects and scaling
- [ ] Test balance at level 1
- [ ] Consider interaction with Oaths
- [ ] Create flavor text for each aura
- [ ] Design progression/evolution system
