## Spell Descriptions

### Searing
**Effect:** The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell’s duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity. The attack deals an extra 1d10 + 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames, causing 1 damage per turn for 2 turns.

### Thunderous
**Effect:** The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your weapon rings with thunder audible within 300 feet of you. The attack deals an extra 1d10 thunder damage to the target. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone.

### Branding
**Effect:** The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it is invisible. The target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can’t become invisible until the spell ends.

### Wrathful
**Effect:** The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.

### Blinding
**Effect:** The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your weapon flares with a bright light. The attack deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends. A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

### Staggering
**Effect:** The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind. The attack deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can’t take reactions, until the end of its next turn.

### Banishing
**Effect:** The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon crackles with force. The attack deals an extra 5d10 force damage to the target. Additionally, if this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points or fewer, you banish it. If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target disappears, returning to its home plane. If the target is native to the plane you’re on, the creature vanishes into a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. It remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
