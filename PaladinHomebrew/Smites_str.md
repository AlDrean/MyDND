# Paladin Smite Spells - Strength Build (Damage Focus)

> **Build Philosophy:** These smites are designed for the Strength-focused Paladin build. Upcasting focuses on **raw damage amplification** rather than utility, emphasizing upfront burst damage and straightforward combat effectiveness.

---

## Smite System Overview

### Two-Tier Smite System

At **5th level**, Strength-focused Paladins **do not receive Extra Attack**. Instead, they gain a unique smite system:

> **Important:** You make **one attack per turn** when you take the Attack action. This single attack always includes a smite effect. You do not gain the Extra Attack feature.

1. **Base Smite (Cantrip-Level)**: Always available when you make your melee weapon attack
   - **Oath-Specific:** Each Paladin Oath grants access to their signature smite as a cantrip
   - No spell slot required
   - Higher base damage than CHAR build, guaranteed 1-turn effect
   - No concentration required
   - Your oath's signature smite is always available; other smites can be learned as spells
   - **Every Attack Action:** When you take the Attack action, you make one attack with a smite (you cannot make a normal attack without a smite)

2. **Upcast Smite (Spell Slot)**: Enhance your base smite with a bonus action
   - Requires a bonus action + spell slot
   - Full concentration effect (up to 1 minute)
   - **Damage Scaling:** +1d6 or +1d8 damage per spell level above base
   - Straightforward damage increase, minimal utility

**Mechanics:**
- **Attack Action:** Make **one** melee weapon attack with a base smite effect (choose type). You cannot make multiple attacks.
- **Bonus Action (Optional):** Upcast the smite using a spell slot to gain the full concentration version
- **Concentration:** Only required when upcast; base effect is instantaneous/1 turn
- **+Strength to Attack:** You add your Strength modifier to the attack roll when using a smite
- **No Extra Attack:** You do not gain the Extra Attack feature at 5th level or any other level

## Oath-Specific Smite Cantrips

Each Paladin Oath grants access to a specific smite cantrip that reflects their core philosophy. At 5th level, when you choose the Strength build path, you gain your oath's signature smite as a cantrip-level ability.

| Smite | Associated Oath | Thematic Connection |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Searing Smite** | Oath of Vengeance | Burning retribution against those who have wronged others |
| **Thunderous Smite** | Oath of the Ancients | Nature's raw power and fury, storms and primal forces |
| **Wrathful Smite** | Oath of Conquest | Fear and domination, breaking enemy resolve |
| **Branding Smite** | Oath of the Watchers | Vigilance and revelation, exposing hidden threats |
| **Blinding Smite** | Oath of Devotion | Holy light and purity, revealing truth through divine radiance |
| **Staggering Smite** | Oath of the Crown | Maintaining order through control, protecting the realm |
| **Banishing Smite** | Oath of Redemption | Removing threats non-lethally, giving second chances through exile |

> **Note:** While each oath has a signature smite, Paladins can still learn and use other smite spells through their spell list. The oath-specific smite is simply always available as a cantrip-level ability.

## How It Works in Practice

### Example Turn Sequence

**Turn 1 - Basic Attack:**
- **Action:** Attack action (one attack) with Searing Smite (base effect)
  - Hit deals weapon damage + 1d6 fire damage
  - Target takes 1 fire damage at start of next 2 turns
  - No spell slot used, no concentration
  - Note: You only make one attack (no Extra Attack)

**Turn 2 - Enhanced Attack:**
- **Action:** Attack action (one attack) with Thunderous Smite (base effect)
  - Hit deals weapon damage + 1d8 thunder damage
  - Target pushed 10 ft and prone (save negates)
- **Bonus Action:** Upcast Thunderous Smite with 3rd-level slot
  - Next hit will deal 3d8 thunder damage (base 1d8 + 2d8 from upcast)
  - Uses concentration
  - Note: You only make one attack per turn (no Extra Attack)

**Turn 3 - Maximum Damage:**
- **Action:** Attack action (one attack) with Blinding Smite (base effect)
  - Hit deals weapon damage + 2d8 radiant damage
  - Target blinded until end of its next turn
- **Bonus Action:** Upcast Blinding Smite with 5th-level slot
  - Next hit will deal 4d8 radiant damage (base 2d8 + 2d8 from upcast)
  - Note: You only make one attack per turn (no Extra Attack)

### Strategic Considerations

- **Damage Maximization:** Base smites provide solid damage; upcasts dramatically increase burst potential
- **Resource Management:** Upcasts cost spell slots but provide significant damage increases (+2 dice per level)
- **Simplicity:** Straightforward damage scaling, no complex utility to manage
- **Burst Potential:** High-level upcasts can deal massive single-hit damage
- **Consistency:** Base effects are reliable and always available

---

## Design Notes

### Damage vs. Utility Philosophy
- **STR Build Focus:** These smites emphasize raw damage output and straightforward combat effectiveness
- **Upcasting Strategy:** Each level adds +2 damage dice (simple, predictable scaling)
- **Minimal Versatility:** Effects are straightforward - damage and basic conditions only
- **Synergy:** Works with standard Paladin auras and straightforward combat tactics

### Key Differences from CHAR Build
- Slightly higher base damage on all smites (e.g., Searing: 1d6 vs CHAR's 1d4)
- Upcasts add +1d6 or +1d8 damage per level (simple damage scaling, not utility effects)
- Focus on upfront burst damage rather than area control
- Same oath assignments for consistency
- Standard auras (not modified like CHAR build)
- Total damage per turn: Weapon + Smite Damage + STR Modifier + Weaker Effect

### Integration with Level 5 Feature
- **No Extra Attack:** STR Paladins do NOT receive the Extra Attack feature at 5th level
- **Single Attack with Smite:** When you take the Attack action, you make **one attack** that always includes a smite effect
- **Cannot Make Normal Attacks:** You cannot make a weapon attack without applying a smite effect
- **Oath Signature Smite:** Your oath's signature smite is always available as a cantrip-level ability
- **Base Smite Always Available:** Your single attack per turn always applies your oath's base smite effect (no cost)
- **+Strength to Attack:** You add your Strength modifier to the attack roll when using a smite
- **Optional Upcast:** Use bonus action + spell slot to enhance your oath's smite (or any learned smite) to full concentration version
- **Damage Scaling:** Upcasts add +1d6 or +1d8 damage per spell level above base (varies by smite type)
- **Damage Formula:** Base = Weapon + Smite Damage + STR Modifier + Weaker Effect | Upcast = Weapon + Smite Damage (upcasted) + Weaker Effect (with upcast)
- **Learning Other Smites:** While your oath grants one signature smite as a cantrip, you can still learn other smite spells from the Paladin spell list
