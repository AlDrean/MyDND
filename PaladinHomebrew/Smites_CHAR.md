## Smite System Overview

### Two-Tier Smite System

   - **Oath-Specific:** Each Paladin Oath grants access to their signature smite as a cantrip
   - No spell slot required
   - Weaker, guaranteed 1-turn effect
   - No concentration required
   - Your oath's signature smite is always available; other smites can be learned as spells
   - **Every Attack Action:** When you take the Attack action, you CAN  one attack with a smite cas cantropy

2. **Upcast Smite (Spell Slot)**: Enhance your base smite with a bonus action
   - Requires a bonus action + spell slot
   - Full concentration effect (up to 1 minute)
   - Enhanced control and utility effects
   - Can be dropped anytime (uses movement + bonus action upkeep)

**Mechanics:**
- **Attack Action:** Make **one** melee weapon attack with a base smite effect (based on the oath). You cannot make multiple attacks.

|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Searing Smite** | Oath of Vengeance | Burning retribution against those who have wronged others |
| **Thunderous Smite** | Oath of the Ancients | Nature's raw power and fury, storms and primal forces |

| **Banishing Smite** | Oath of Redemption | Removing threats non-lethally, giving second chances through exile |

## How It Works in Practice

### Example Turn Sequence

**Turn 1 - Basic Attack:**
- **Action:** Attack action (one attack) with Searing Smite (base effect)
  - Hit deals weapon damage + 1d4 fire damage
  - Target takes 1d4 fire at start of next turn
  - No spell slot used, no concentration
  - Note: You only make one attack (no Extra Attack)

**Turn 2 - Enhanced Attack:**
- **Action:** Attack action (one attack) with Thunderous Smite (base effect)
  - Hit deals weapon damage + 1d6 thunder damage
  - Target pushed 5 ft and prone (save negates)
- **Bonus Action:** Upcast Thunderous Smite with 2nd-level slot
  - Now have concentration version active
  - Next hit will push 15 ft, affect nearby creatures
  - Uses movement + bonus action each turn to maintain
  - Note: You only make one attack per turn (no Extra Attack)

**Turn 3 - Switch Tactics:**
- **Action:** Attack with Wrathful Smite (base effect)
  - Hit deals weapon damage + 1d4 psychic damage
  - Target frightened until end of its next turn
- **Bonus Action:** Drop Thunderous Smite concentration (free)
- **Movement:** Used to maintain (if had upcast active)

### Strategic Considerations

- **Resource Management:** Base smites are free, upcasts cost spell slots
- **Concentration Trade-offs:** Upcast smites require concentration, limiting other spells
- **Flexibility:** Mix and match smite types based on situation
- **Control Focus:** Base effects provide immediate 1-turn control; upcasts extend duration and area
- **Action Economy:** Bonus action upcast allows same-turn enhancement

---

## Design Notes

### Control vs. Damage Philosophy
- **CHAR Build Focus:** These smites emphasize battlefield control, area denial, and tactical advantages
- **Upcasting Strategy:** Each level increases utility, area of effect, duration, or number of targets rather than raw damage
- **Synergy:** Works with the Paladin's aura system and "hold the line" playstyle

### Key Differences from STR Build
- Lower base damage on some smites (e.g., Searing: 1d6 vs 1d10+1d6)
- Upcasts add utility/control rather than +2 damage dice
- Focus on area effects, conditions, and battlefield manipulation
- Better synergy with Charisma-based features and auras

### Integration with Level 5 Feature
- **No Extra Attack:** CHAR Paladins do NOT receive the Extra Attack feature at 5th level
- **Single Attack with Smite:** When you take the Attack action, you make **one attack** that always includes a smite effect
- **Cannot Make Normal Attacks:** You cannot make a weapon attack without applying a smite effect
- **Oath Signature Smite:** Your oath's signature smite is always available as a cantrip-level ability
- **Base Smite Always Available:** Your single attack per turn always applies your oath's base smite effect (no cost)
- **+Charisma to Attack:** You add your Charisma modifier to the attack roll when using a smite
- **Optional Upcast:** Use bonus action + spell slot to enhance your oath's smite (or any learned smite) to full concentration version
- **Additional Concentration Slot:** One extra concentration slot specifically for smite upkeep
- **Upkeep Cost:** Movement and bonus action to maintain upcast smite (can be dropped anytime)
- **Learning Other Smites:** While your oath grants one signature smite as a cantrip, you can still learn other smite spells from the Paladin spell list
