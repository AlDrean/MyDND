# D&D Repository

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to my Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) endeavors. Here, you'll find my homebrews, character details, lore tests, and various D&D-related projects. I'm currently focused on 5th Edition (5e) rules and mechanics.

## Current Projects

### Paladin Homebrew
**Objective:** Transform the Paladin class from a damage-dealer using Divine Smite into a control-type tank.
- **To Do:**
  - Document the idea behind why and how I want to change the Paladin.
  - Rewrite the README file since setting up this git overwrote the original.
  - Perform calculations (using programs) on damage and other mechanics.

### Rurholl
**Objective:** Develop lore and background stories for Rurholl and his companions.
- **To Do:**
  - Continue playing Rurholl and documenting bits of lore about him and his friends.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the content! Any feedback or suggestions are always welcome.
